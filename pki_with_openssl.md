## Key and Certificate Management
- Key algorithm
  - for web server keys everyone uses RSA
  - For SSH, DSA and RSA are widely used
- Key size
  - Today, 2,048-bit RSA keys are considered secure
  - Aim also to use 2,048 bits for DSA keys and at least 256 bits for ECDSA
- Passphrase
  - strongly recommended
  - Protected keys can be safely stored, transported, and backed up
  - but either too inconvenient or has unacceptable availability implications
  - using protected keys in production does not actually increase the security much
    - because, once activated, private keys are kept unprotected in program memory; an attacker who can get to the server can get the keys
   - Thus, passphrases should be viewed only as a mechanism for protecting private keys when they are not installed on production systems.
- To generate an RSA key, use the genrsa command
  - itâ€™s best to stay away from the other algorithms(DES, 3DES, and SEED)
  - Private keys are stored in the so-called PEM format

    - "although the HTTP/2 standard itself does not require the use of encryption, most client implementations (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, IE, Edge) have said they will only support HTTP/2 over TLS, which makes encryption de facto mandatory."
