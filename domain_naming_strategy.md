# Domain Naming Strategy
- Buy an official and external domain from a DNS hosting service such as
  - blahblah.com
- Define internal domains using subdomains derived from the external domain, blahblah.com, such as
  - dev.blahblah.com
  - stage.blahblah.com
  - intra.blahblah.com
  - why should we use subdomains?
    - https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/choose-internal-top-level-domain-name
    - https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/34981.active-directory-best-practices-for-internal-domain-and-network-names.aspx
- Buy a certificate for SSL/TLS communication with a CSR that specifies all those defined domains as SAN(Subject Alt Name)s for example,
  - CN=blahblah.com
  - SAN=
    - blahblah.com
    - *.blahblah.com
    - *.dev.blahblah.com
    - *.stage.blahblah.com
    - *.intra.blahblah.com
  - This way, you can save costs 
  - to buy many certificates 
  - to manage and deploy site and CA certificates for servers and clients.
- Setup DNS servers separately for internal and external domains
  - The internal DNS has to be acceable only by internal clients and hosts
